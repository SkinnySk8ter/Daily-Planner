[Look Out!]

Hello Again! We are back and this time we are creating a daily planner to assist you with your day to day progress and make sure that you are able to stay on top of things! Within this document you will be able to change your assignments in real time and also have the ability toi be notified via color coding when an event has passed. 

[How To Setup]
The files within this document are going to be updated on a regular basis! However....there are some things to be aware of.

1. The first save button WILL NOT SAVE at this exact second. Currently working on a fix

2. In order to effectively save your results...make sure you delete EVERYTHING in the text box before hitting the SAVE button. The save button automatically adds quotation marks after you hit it and refresh the page. 

3. Working on getting the text boxes to change colors depending on the time of day
