[Look Out!]

Hello Again! We are back and this time we are creating a daily planner to assist you with your day to day progress and make sure that you are able to stay on top of things! Within this document you will be able to change your assignments in real time and also have the ability toi be notified via color coding when an event has passed. 

[How To Setup]
The files within this document are going to be updated on a regular basis! However....there are some things to be aware of.

1.The css style sheet is located in the assets/css directory.

2.The Javascript was originally located in a seperate file from the html doc. However, due to the errors that were received I decided to put the code of both html and javascript into one complete file and keep the style sheet seperate. In the future this will be addressed but for right now due to time this is here for the time being.

3.All of the pages are linked together so feel free to click away to explore!

4.As stated before, this is a work in progress! Notes on things that have not been worked out yet are marked in green notation (or possibly another color depending on what you prefer).



[Look-Out!]
As stated before the page is still a work in progress! Currently working on a fix to making the javascript file readable without the amount of errors that were being presented. Currently working on a fix to make sure that the text does not dissappear when the page is refreshed! (stay tuned an update is coming soon!)
